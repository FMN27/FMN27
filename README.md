5/21/24: Got my computer up and runnining so that I could finally use the platforms needed to do this project
5/23/24: Began watching the video that Mr.Jones posted in the assignment module on Cnavas
5/27/24: Started to mess around with some code and look at some examples
5/28/24: I began to work on the starting action of the robot, I went through some of the examples on vs code and rewatched part of the video and incorporated code that would allow my robot to locate the opponent on the battlefield
5/29/24: I grinded out the rest of the project and got it done. I added the rest of the actions such as running, spinning, targeting, and shooting. The robot is now able to go out thee is confue the enemy so and then fire when it least expects it
It was only last minute that I realized that I had forgotten to update the log with the time slots that I worked on this project. We can now only hope for the best.
